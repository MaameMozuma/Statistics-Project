# Question of Presentation: DOES THE HAPPINESS LEVEL OF INDIVIDUALS AFFECT THEIR WELL-BEING IN THE UK?

- Several theories have been proposed on the impact of happiness on one’s health.
- The dominant explanation for this link is that happy people take better care of themselves by engaging in healthy habits such as getting enough sleep and exercising, to name a few (MacMillan, 2017). 
- Previous literature reviews focused on unique elements of people’s health rather than their overall health. 
- To fill the gaps in existing research, I analyse the relationship between an individual’s happiness level and general wellbeing in the United Kingdom using data from Round 9 of the European Social Survey.
- RStudio, a statistical analysis software, was used to summarise the data set, which included a total of 2204 persons.
- Inferential tests, notably the Chi-Squared and Post Hoc tests, were employed to test the preliminary categorical to categorical relationship obtained from the summaries.
- After researching and analysing results, it was evident that there is a relationship between happiness levels and individual general wellbeing in the United Kingdom.
